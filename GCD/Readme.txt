Finding GCD of two numbers using Elucid Algorithm or Dijakstra Algorithm (using recursion)

Elucid Algorithm :
using modulus operator to find remainder. If the remainder is zero , GCD is the denominator i.e lowest integer , else we go on using modulo operator to reach the if condition 

Dijakstra Algorithm :
checking if the two integers are equal , if equal then gcd is the integers. If they are not equal , we subtract the integers and the bigger integer is replace with the answer. This goes on till we get two integer equal.
